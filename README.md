# Neural Network Layer Masking in PyTorch

### Documentation

- Check out my story on Medium:
- https://medium.com/@jonas.schumacher/neural-network-layer-masking-in-pytorch-151dd834476e

### Code Quickstart

- Create virtual environment (e.g., using Python `3.11` or `3.12`)
- Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run code: `python run_masking.py`

### Troubleshooting

- For the `graphviz` pip package to run properly, you first need to install Graphviz on your
  system: https://www.graphviz.org/download/
- However, graphviz was only required for the documentation, so you can also remove those parts from the code
- I tested the code successfully on a Mac using `Python 3.11` and on a Windows machine using `Python 3.12`
