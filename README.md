# Layer Masking in PyTorch

### Quickstart:

- Create virtual environment
- For the `graphviz` pip package to run properly, you first need to install Graphviz on your
  system: https://www.graphviz.org/download/

### Versions

- I tested the code with `Python 3.11` and the package versions in the `requirements.txt`.
- But the code should also be
  runnable with older & newer versions.
